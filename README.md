# RxBluetoothKotlin
Android + BLE + Kotlin + RxJava3

Bluetooth Low Energy on Android made easy with RxJava.

Made with love at the [Equisense](http://equisense.com) HQ. This library is used in our [Equisense app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.equisense.motions) since years.

Looking for BLE with Coroutines instead of RxJava ? Take a look at the [LouisCAD's implementation](https://github.com/Beepiz/BleGattCoroutines).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Android 12 permissions changes ‚ö†Ô∏è
Starting from Android API 31, the fine location permission is not required anymore, instead of this, you have to use the BLUETOOTH_CONNECT and BLUETOOTH_SCAN permissions when dealing the bluetooth low energy framework. Before upgrading `targetSdkVersion` to 31 in your app, check your `requestPermission` calls according to this new permission.

Because of this change, RxBluetoothKotlin was updated to fire the `NeedBluetoothScanPermission` and `NeedBluetoothConnectPermission` exceptions at the right moment if they're missing at the runtime. Theses exceptions are fired since the release `3.2.0`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important notice about Maven Central release ‚ö†Ô∏è
**RxBluetoothKotlin is released on Maven Central** since the version `3.1.0` you don't have to worry about this library when jCenter will shutdown ! Unfortunately, according to the Maven Central policies, I must update my package to match with the host domain I own. I only own `masselis.com`, so the package name RxBluetothKotlin were renamed from `com.vincentmasselis.rxbluetoothkotlin` to `com.masselis.rxbluetoothkotlin`, as consequence, <ins>you have to renamed EVERY import from rxbluetoothkotlin to the new package name</ins>.

## TL/DR

```groovy
// Check the github release section to find the latest available version
implementation 'com.masselis.rxbluetoothkotlin:rxbluetoothkotlin-core:<<latest_version>>'
```

### Scan
```kotlin
val bluetoothManager = context.getSystemService(Context.BLUETOOTH_SERVICE) as BluetoothManager
bluetoothManager.rxScan()
  .subscribe { scanResult ->
  }
```
### Connect
```kotlin
bluetoothDevice.connectRxGatt()
  .flatMapMaybe { gatt -> gatt.whenConnectionIsReady().map { gatt } }
  .subsribe { rxBluetoothGatt ->
  }
```
### Read
```kotlin
rxBluetoothGatt.read(characteristic)
  .subscribe { byteArray ->
  }
```
### Write
```kotlin
rxBluetoothGatt.write(characteristic, byteArray)
  .subscribe { _ ->
  }
```
### Listen
```kotlin
rxBluetoothGatt.enableNotification(characteristic)
  .flatMapPublisher { listenChanges(characteristic) }
  .subscribe { byteArray ->
  }
```
### Disconnect
```kotlin
rxBluetoothGatt.disconnect().subscribe()
```

## Requirements
* Min target API 18
* When <ins>scanning</ins> with RxBluetoothKotlin, you have to grant theses runtime permissions:
    - From Android 6 to 9 inclusive: `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`
    - From Android 10 to 11 inclusive: `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`
    - From Android 12: `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`
* When <ins>connecting</ins> with RxBluetoothKotlin, you have to grant this runtime permission:
    - From Android 12: `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`
* A turned on bluetooth chip `(context.getSystemService(Context.BLUETOOTH_SERVICE) as BluetoothManager).adapter.isEnabled`
* You can add to your manifest `<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.bluetooth_le" android:required="true" />`

## Logging
When scanning with `rxScan()` or connecting with `connectRxGatt()`, you can set the `logger` parameter. By setting it, RxBluetoothKotlin will produce a log for every bluetooth input, output, starting scan, error thrown, etc.. I recommend to set it for debugging purposes and/or if you're not familiar with the Android BLE API. It could helps you a lot to understand what's going on between your app and the Bluetooth Low Energy device.

## Error management
Interact with Bluetooth Low Energy devices on Android is **hard**. The BLE specs uses unfamiliar concepts, the BLE API from Android could fails at any moment and some exceptions are silent. Because of this, a basic method like `write(BluetoothGattCharacteristic)` could fails for 5 different reasons. It becomes harder if you are chaining this call with other calls, this sum up to a thrown exception when it's impossible to known which call fails and why.

For this reason, every public method from this library is documented with every exceptions which could be fired and most of the exception are unique. For example: `write(BluetoothGattCharacteristic)` could fire:
* Unique `CharacteristicWriteDeviceDisconnected` if the device disconnects while writing
* Unique `CannotInitializeCharacteristicWrite` if the Android API returned `false` when calling `writeCharacteristic`
* Unique `CharacteristicWriteFailed` if the characteristic could not be written
* `BluetoothIsTurnedOff` if bluetooth...... is turned off ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
* `BluetoothTimeout` if writing takes more than 1 minute

All the 3 uniques exceptions are containing the required data to understand why it failed. For example `CharacteristicWriteDeviceDisconnected` has 5 fields, `bluetoothDevice`, `status`, `service`, `characteristic` and `value`, all of theses fields should helps you to understand what's going on.

## Demo app
If you're not familiar with the Bluetooth Low Energy API or if you want to try this lib, you can build and run the [demo app](https://github.com/VincentMasselis/RxBluetoothKotlin/tree/master/dev-app) from this repo.

## Decorator pattern
‚ö† Before reading this part, you must know how a [Decorator design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) works and how to make a new one.

On Android, communicating with a Bluetooth device requires an instance of `BluetoothGatt` and an instance of `BluetoothGattCallback`. RxBluetoothKotlin wraps both of theses types into `RxBluetoothGatt` and `RxBluetoothGatt.Callback` types to add some reactive touch to the system objects. Both `RxBluetoothGatt` and `RxBluetoothGatt.Callback` are interfaces, calling `connectRxGatt` will return a default implementation for both of them but you are free to wrap the returned implementation by your own implementation to add you own behavior, you only have to follow the Decorator rules.

### Decorate RxBluetoothGatt
The following diagram will show you which classes are used to create the decorator pattern:

![UML Class diagram](http://yuml.me/63d484c6.svg)

[comment]: <> (Used syntax 
"""
[BluetoothGatt{bg:cornsilk}]<1-<>[<<RxBluetoothGatt>>{bg:lavender}]
[<<RxBluetoothGatt>>]^-.-[RxBluetoothGattImpl{bg:lavender}]
[<<RxBluetoothGatt>>]^-.-[SimpleRxBluetoothGatt{bg:lavender}]
[<<RxBluetoothGatt>>]<1-<>[SimpleRxBluetoothGatt]
[SimpleRxBluetoothGatt]^-[An other Decorator{bg:lightblue}]
[SimpleRxBluetoothGatt]^-[Your Decorator{bg:lightblue}]lue}]
"""
On this website `https://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/class/draw`
)

As you can see, to create a decorator, you only have to subclass `SimpleRxBluetoothGatt`. If you want to decorate `RxBluetoothGatt.Callback` just subclass `SimpleRxBluetoothGattCallback` like you do with `SimpleRxBluetoothGatt` from the previous example.

When your decorators are written you can send them to RxBluetoothKotlin by setting the `rxGattBuilder` and `rxCallbackBuilder` parameters when calling `connectRxGatt`. Defaults implementation of RxBluetoothKotlin uses `RxBluetoothGattImpl` and `RxBluetoothGattCallbackImpl`, by using you own decorator you can change the way RxBluetoothKotlin is communicating with the Android SDK in order to match your own requirements.
